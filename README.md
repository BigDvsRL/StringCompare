# StringCompare

Some of you may want to Filter their Texts which they collected for their Dataset. With my Script you could Compare two Strings and get a Boolean if its Matching or not

The Script will look through every letter. If you like, you could change the Threshhold for yourself. So if you like to check for a 100% Match, then just set the Threshhold to 1 or you're okay with a 10% Match, then use a Threshhold of 0.1...

You could also set some letters or signs you want to skip, doesnt matter if its a single Letter as String or a List of Letters
